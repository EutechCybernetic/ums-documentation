# Integrations

Integrations allow you to sync meter configuration and meter data from 3rd party sources.

UMS has built-in integrations to acquire data and configuration via the iviva IBMS application.

It can also receive data from an integration built on Lucy.

The application also provides API end points to ingest consumption data.
